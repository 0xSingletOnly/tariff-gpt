# Tariff GPT
It's April 2025, and DJT has announced an extensive tariffs plan on many economies. As a Singaporean, I'm similarly shocked that we are hit with a 10% tariff even despite of the healthy relationship between these two countries.

Tariff-GPT is my attempt to use AI to understand these tariffs and their impact on Singapore. I will be detailed my steps in data collection, data processing, RAG and agentic implementation.
