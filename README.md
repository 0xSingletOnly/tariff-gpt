# Tariff GPT
It's April 2025, and DJT has announced an extensive tariffs plan on many economies. As a Singaporean, I'm similarly shocked that we are hit with a 10% tariff even despite of the healthy relationship between these two countries.

Tariff-GPT is my attempt to use AI to understand these tariffs and their impact on Singapore. I will be detailed my steps in data collection, data processing, RAG and agentic implementation. 

## Data collection
Given the small dataset that I wanted to collect, I manually googled news articles covering Trump's tariffs. Here is the breakdown of article types:
- 4 articles on general Trump tariff policies
- 5 articles specifically analyzing Singapore impact
- 4 articles on broader Asia/ASEAN implications
- 2-3 expert opinion pieces/editorials

I collected these articles from a variety of sources, including CNA and The Straits Times for Singapore coverage, and Bloomberg/Financial Times for global coverage.
