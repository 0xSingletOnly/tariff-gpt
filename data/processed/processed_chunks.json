That hope, however, was tempered by the worsening rhetoric between Trump and Beijing and rising chances of a global recession. Trump threatened Monday to impose additional 50 percent tariffs on China if Beijing did not \u201cwithdraw\u201d its retaliatory measures on Tuesday, a move that would take duties on Chinese-made goods to at least 104 percent \u2014 and in some cases more.

Trump signaled Monday that he was open to cutting deals with countries to ease tariffs, even as White House officials continued to suggest there would be no quick end to new import duties. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country.

    "content": "WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - A global trade war touched off by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs escalated further on Monday, as Trump threatened to increase duties on China and the European Union proposed counter-tariffs of its own. Financial markets across the globe posted a third day of losses as investors worried that steep trade barriers around the world's largest consumer market could lead to a recession. The S&P 500 closed lower after a rollercoaster session in which it touched its lowest level in more than a year. Sign up here. Trump said the tariffs - a minimum of 10% for all U.S. imports, with targeted rates of up to 50% - would help the United States recapture an industrial base that he says has withered over decades of trade liberalization. \"It's the only chance our country will have to reset the table. Because no other president would be willing to do what I'm doing, or to even go through it,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"Now, I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end.\" Trump spoke hours after he ratcheted up a confrontation with China, the world's No. 2 economy. Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China on Wednesday if it did not withdraw the 34% tariffs it had imposed on U.S. products last week. Those Chinese tariffs had come in response to 34% \"reciprocal\" duties announced by Trump. The European Commission, meanwhile, proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list, according to a document seen by Reuters. Officials said they stood ready to negotiate a \"zero for zero\" deal with Trump's administration. \"Sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the U.S. and find a mutually acceptable compromise,\" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a news conference. The 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20% tariff on other products on Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on EU alcoholic drinks. Trump said his administration would open trade talks with Japan, one of Washington's closest allies in Asia, and administration officials say dozens of other countries have reached out as well with the hope of heading off the tariffs as high as 50% due to take effect on Wednesday. The back-and-forth injected further turbulence into global financial markets, which have fallen steadily since Trump's announcement. U.S. stocks swung wildly, spiking after a report that Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause, then turned negative again after the White House dismissed the report as \"fake news.\" Asian and European shares plunged as investors feared the duties Trump has likened to \"medicine\" could lead to higher prices, weaker demand and potentially a global recession. Goldman Sachs raised the odds of a U.S. recession to 45%. Trump administration officials say the president is following through on a promise to reverse decades of trade liberalization that he believes has undercut the U.S. economy. But they also said he is willing to negotiate with dozens of countries that have reached out for talks. \"He's doubling down on something that he knows works, and he's going to continue to do that,\" White House economist Kevin Hassett said on Fox News. \"But he is also going to listen to our trading partners, and if they come to us with really great deals that advantage American manufacturing and American farmers, I'm sure he'll listen.\" U.S. President Donald Trump returns to Washington Item 1 of 3 U.S. President Donald Trump talks to members of the press aboard Air Force One during a flight to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, U.S., April 6, 2025.

Beijing called Trump's behavior \"economic bullying\". After stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday, China's sovereign fund stepped in to try to stabilise the market. Shares in Taiwan plummeted almost 10% - the biggest one-day percentage fall on record. Wall Street leaders issued warnings on U.S. tariffs, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) , opens new tab CEO Jamie Dimon saying they could have lasting negative consequences, while fund manager Bill Ackman said they could lead to an \"economic nuclear winter.\" Ackman is one of a handful of Trump supporters who questioned the strategy. Billionaire Elon Musk, who is leading Trump's effort to slash government spending, called for zero tariffs between the U.S. and Europe over the weekend. On Monday, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed the Tesla CEO as a \"car assembler.\" NEW REALITY OR NEGOTIATING PLOY? Investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether Trump's tariffs are permanent or a pressure tactic to win concessions from other countries. Some in the EU worry that a forceful response risks even more blowback on European exporters of everything from French cognac and Italian wine to German cars. Volkswagen's Audi is holding back cars that arrived in U.S. ports after April 2 because of the newly imposed 25% auto tariff.

Shows market loss Some governments in Asia have signalled a willingness to engage. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te on Sunday offered zero tariffs as the basis for talks, while an Indian government official said Delhi does not plan to retaliate. Investors are now betting that the growing risk of recession could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates as early as next month. Trump repeated his call for the central bank to lower rates on Monday, but Fed chief Jerome Powell has so far indicated he is in no rush.

    "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 There will be disastrous consequences for the world if disputes between the US and China escalate, destabilising the relationship between both countries, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. In a wide-ranging speech on the impact of US tariffs in Parliament on April 8, he outlined the potential impact of the Trump administration\u2019s move on US-China relations. The US views China as a strategic competitor and threat to be dealt with now, while the US still has the advantage, he said. He added: \u201cChina says it is ready for a tariff war, a trade war, or any other type of war. The US has now threatened an extra 50 per cent tariff on China, and China says it will fight till the end.\u201d And there are fewer channels for dialogue, which can serve as guard rails to manage the relationship, he said. \u201cWe must be mentally prepared. The predictable and rules-based order we once knew is fading,\u201d PM Wong said. \u201cThe new era will be more volatile, with more frequent and unpredictable shocks. We must be ready to stand firm, and protect our interests, no matter how the external winds may blow.\u201d Get key highlights in the lead-up to Polling Day.

Yes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's SPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers. marketing and promotions. America\u2019s tariff moves arise from a sense that the US has given away too much in allowing China to join the World Trade Organisation (World Trade Organization (WTO)), and that China competes on an unfair basis by heavily subsidising its own companies and restricting market access to US firms, PM Wong said. Such views may arise with people from hollowed-out towns in what was once America\u2019s thriving industrial belt, where jobs have disappeared and workers\u2019 incomes stagnated. \u201cThey believe that the American economy is fundamentally broken,\u201d PM Wong said, noting that the US objectively continues to enjoy unrivalled economic heft in totality. But America\u2019s concerns should be addressed within the WTO framework, he said. \u201cIn particular, the trade arrangements and concessions made in the past when China was only 5 per cent of the world\u2019s economy should be updated when China now makes up 15 per cent of the world\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (gross domestic product). \u201cAnd if there are disagreements, they should be resolved through the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, which has been paralysed, and urgently needs to be restored and reformed.\u201d He added: \u201cBut what the US is doing now is not reform. It is rejecting the very system it created.\u201d More on this Topic US tariffs will significantly impact S\u2019pore\u2019s growth; Budget 2025 to help in short term: PM Wong New task force to address impact of US tariffs will focus on engagement, information sharing: DPM Gan PM Wong noted that Asia bears the brunt of the US tariff increases, with China the hardest hit in the region. With China, the 34 per cent tariff laid out this round adds to a 20 per cent tariff increase imposed over the past two months, and a further 20 per cent from the first Trump administration, PM Wong said. \u201cTaken together, the average US tariff on Chinese products now exceeds 60 per cent.\u201d Meanwhile, tariff rates range from 10 per cent to 49 per cent in South-east Asia, he added. Singapore was among the countries hit by a \u201cbaseline tariff\u201d of 10 per cent that US President Donald Trump announced on April 2. PM Wong said: \u201cThese measures will accelerate the fracturing of the global economy. \u201cInstead of flowing based on economic efficiency, capital and trade will increasingly be diverted based on political alignment and strategic considerations.\u201d A total of 14 MPs, including Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh, rose to ask questions after PM Wong\u2019s speech. Nominated MP Neil Parekh asked if the Government would direct Singapore\u2019s \u201csovereign wealth system\u201d to make investments in the US if asked to do so as part of tariff negotiations. This includes investment companies GIC and Temasek, which are managed independently, Mr Parekh noted. PM Wong said these funds, which have major investments in America today, operate \u201cstrictly on a commercial basis... and not for diplomatic or political considerations\u201d. They will continue to adopt this approach. \u201cIf, indeed, the continued investments that Singapore as a whole is making in the US help advance a bilateral relationship, so much the better,\u201d he said. More on this Topic PM Wong on 3 implications US tariffs have on global trading system Trump\u2019s tariffs: What are Singapore\u2019s possible options in responding? Mr Parekh and Workers\u2019 Party MP Jamus Lim (Sengkang GRC) both asked about the use of anti-dumping duties to curb a potential influx of low-priced imports from countries facing higher tariffs. This would be aimed at supporting domestic firms. Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong said anti-dumping duties are provided for under the WTO. But Singapore consumers will end up bearing the cost of such duties, he said, adding that Singapore\u2019s industries are competitive and mostly export-oriented. \u201cTherefore, I think we have to be very careful in considering introducing anti-dumping duties,\u201d said Mr Gan, who is also Trade and Industry Minister. Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) asked how the void in global leadership left by the US can be filled, and about the role Singapore can play. PM Wong said Singapore will not be able to fill the vacuum itself, but can do its best to speak up, corral and engage like-minded countries. He also said the Government intends to strengthen trade links with promising areas, including parts of Latin America and the Middle East, in an earlier reply to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang). While Singapore will engage with the US on whether it can address any misperceptions about bilateral trade, PM Wong cautioned that if the US decides the 10 per cent rate is a universal one, it ultimately reflects its worldview and transcends bilateral considerations. Singapore continues to value other aspects of the overall relationship with America, he said. \u201cWe believe the US values it, too, in areas like security and defence. We have such a close relationship built up over many decades and we will continue to maintain that \u2013 and we will also discuss cooperation in new areas like critical new technologies as well as energy.\u201d",

    "content": "Singapore fears tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump will trigger a global trade war that will be particularly damaging for trade-dependent small nations, the city-state\u2019s foreign minister has said. Vivian Balakrishnan told the Financial Times that while the 10 per cent duty Trump set for imports from Singapore was among the lowest in the Asia Pacific, the city-state\u2019s role as an international financial and commercial hub made it highly vulnerable. \u201cOur greatest fear is that this set of announcements has shaken the foundational pillars of the world trading system right down to the core,\u201d said Balakrishnan in an interview. \u201cIf that collapses and everything becomes an infinite series of bilaterals, it\u2019s going to be very hostile for small nations. And especially small nations who, like ours, are explicitly sensitive to global trade,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a global trade war that we are really afraid of.\u201d Balakrishnan\u2019s comments came after Prime Minister Lawrence Wong told Singaporeans in a video address last week that Trump\u2019s tariffs marked the end of the era of globalisation and free trade and the dawn of a period that would be \u201cmore arbitrary, protectionist and dangerous\u201d. \u201cWe risk being squeezed out, marginalised and left behind,\u201d Wong said. Analysts have forecast that as the US becomes more protectionist, other countries will seek to tighten trading ties with China. Asked whether Beijing would emerge as a stronger player in global trade as a result, Balakrishnan said: \u201cAt a superficial level, the answer is probably yes.\u201d But he added that China\u2019s prospects were also heavily affected by its own economic problems, including stagnating domestic demand. \u201cThis global trade war could not have come at a worse time, both for China as well as all China\u2019s partners, and that includes us,\u201d he said. Singapore\u2019s role as an international financial and commercial hub, linking the west with China, makes its economy particularly sensitive to disruptions in global trade. The city-state\u2019s trade is equivalent to more than three times its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The US raised tariffs on Chinese imports to an average above 60 per cent last week, as part of a sweeping package covering more than 150 countries and territories. Beijing retaliated with its own additional tariff of 34 per cent on all US goods and a slew of other measures, including restrictions on rare earth exports and a probe of the China subsidiary of US chemicals giant DuPont. Trump on Monday threatened an additional 50 per cent tariff on China, further roiling global markets. Singapore has a delicate task in maintaining its close relations with both the US and China. Mainland China is its biggest trading partner, with total goods trade worth $126bn last year, while the US is third behind Malaysia, worth $98bn. Singapore is one of the few countries where the US enjoys a trade surplus, valued at $30bn last year. Several of Singapore\u2019s neighbours in south-east Asia were hit hard by Trump\u2019s tariffs announcement last week, especially those where the US has a trade deficit.

Cambodia was hit with duties of 49 per cent, Vietnam 46 per cent, Thailand 36 per cent, Indonesia 32 per cent and Malaysia 24 per cent in a blow to Asian manufacturing. Over the weekend, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said his country would use its position as chair of the Asean regional bloc to co-ordinate a response to the US aimed at limiting the damage. Balakrishnan said Singapore was less concerned about its own 10 per cent tariff than the rates imposed on its neighbours and trading partners, as well as the potential for sector-based tariffs to come.",

    "content": "The writer is President Trump\u2019s senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing The international trade system is broken \u2014 and Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff doctrine will fix it. This long-overdue restructuring will make both the US and global economies more resilient and prosperous by restoring fairness and balance to a system rigged against America. For decades, under the biased rules of the World Trade Organization, the US has faced systematically higher tariffs from its major trading partners and far more punitive non-tariff barriers. The result is a national emergency that threatens both our economic prosperity and national security. At the heart of this crisis is a trade deficit in goods that has ballooned to more than $1tn annually. The economic models of free trade that predict chronic trade imbalances will always be eliminated through price adjustments via exchange rates are dead wrong. The US cumulative trade deficits in goods from 1976 \u2014 the year chronic deficits began \u2014 to 2024 have transferred over $20tn of American wealth into foreign hands. That\u2019s more than 60 per cent of US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2024. Foreign interests have taken over vast swaths of US farmland, housing, tech companies, and even parts of our food supply. A central driver of this one-sided trade is the World Trade Organization (WTO)\u2019s \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d (MFN) rule, which requires member countries to apply the lowest tariff they offer to any one nation to all WTO members. America\u2019s trading partners can maintain high, uniform tariffs across the board \u2014 with no incentive to negotiate fairer terms with the US. Since 1979, the year that manufacturing jobs peaked in America and the Tokyo round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ushered in major MFN-driven tariff reductions, the US has lost 6.8mn manufacturing jobs. Since China joined the WTO in 2001, real median weekly earnings in the US have largely stagnated \u2014 rising little more than 10 per cent over the entire period. Today, the average US MFN tariff is just 3.3 per cent. China\u2019s is double that at 7.5 per cent. Thailand and Vietnam both hover near 10 per cent and India stands at a staggering 17 per cent. The imbalance extends to autos: the EU charges four times the US car tariff at 10 per cent for saloon cars, China\u2019s base import tariff for passenger vehicles is 25 per cent. Even worse than this is the barrage of non-tariff weapons foreign nations use to strangle American exports, unfairly boost their shipments to the US, and wall off their own markets. These tools include currency manipulation, value added tax distortions, dumping, export subsidies, state-owned enterprises, IP theft, discriminatory product standards, quotas, bans, opaque licensing regimes, burdensome customs procedures, data localisation mandates and, increasingly, the use of \u201clawfare\u201d in places like the EU to target America\u2019s largest tech firms. On top of that, many foreign competitors operate from sweatshops and pollution havens that morally and environmentally stain the global landscape from Asia and Africa to Latin America. While the WTO technically allows challenges, its dispute resolution system is functionally broken \u2014 and the consequences have been catastrophic. The US has brought several high-profile agricultural trade disputes to the WTO \u2014 targeting foreign bans on poultry, hormone-treated beef, and genetically modified crops. In nearly every case the US prevailed. But the victories did not matter. The EU\u2019s ban on hormone-treated US beef was challenged in 1996, ruled illegal in 1998, and yet the EU has not lifted it. A trade system where we face higher tariffs, steeper non-tariff barriers and no viable path to resolution is nothing more than an \u201chonour system\u201d in a world with no honour among cheaters. That\u2019s why America must \u2014 and now is \u2014 defending itself. Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariff doctrine does exactly what the WTO has failed to do: it holds foreign countries accountable. The US will now match the substantially higher tariffs and crushing non-tariff barriers imposed on us by other nations. This is about fairness, and no one can argue with that. This is not a negotiation. For the US, it is a national emergency triggered by trade deficits caused by a rigged system. President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs \u2014 know this: that\u2019s just the beginning. We will want to hear from countries including Cambodia, Mexico and Vietnam that you will stop allowing China to evade US tariffs by trans-shipping exports through your countries. The far bigger threat lies in the web of non-tariff barriers that continue to choke American industries. And that, too, must end. All America wants is fairness. President Trump is simply charging you what you are charging us. What is fairer than that?",

    "content": "President Trump unveiled a new tariff regime on Wednesday that represents a fundamental rethinking of U.S. trade policy on a scale not seen since the post-World War II era. The U.S. will impose 10% across-the-board tariffs on all imports and even higher rates for other nations that the White House considers bad actors on trade. The tariffs come on top of a series of duties that Trump already imposed early in his second term, including tariffs on many products from Canada, Mexico and China, as well as on steel and aluminum. Trump\u2019s rationale is that tariffs will resuscitate U.S. manufacturing, cut the U.S. trade deficit and help reduce the national debt. Detractors say the tariffs could upend global trade and lead to higher inflation. Here\u2019s what to know about his latest announcement: What tariffs did Trump impose? All U.S. imports will be subject to a 10% tariff, effective April 5. Some nations, however, will be hit with higher tariff rates that start April 9. For example, a 34% duty will apply to China, 20% for Europe and 24% for Japan. Trump called the latter a \u201cdiscounted reciprocal tariff,\u201d explaining that the U.S. will be charging half the tariff rate that many nations impose on U.S. products. The White House posted more country-specific tariff rates on one of its X accounts. A new 34% tariff on China will add to previous duties, such as the 20% tariff Trump imposed over fentanyl. The base tariff rate on Chinese imports will be 54%, before adding tariffs imposed during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency or Trump\u2019s first term. Trump had flagged over the weekend that he might target almost all of America\u2019s trading partners, but the combination of a universal tariff plus country-specific tariffs was a surprise. Also in his speech Wednesday, Trump confirmed that a 25% tariff on foreign-made automobiles would go into effect on Thursday, April 3. One of the options President Trump is considering involve\u200bs reciprocal tariffs\u2014reflecting rates other nations charge the U.S. Economists explain why this \u2018tit for tat\u2019 strategy isn\u2019t effective trade policy.. Photo Illustration: Josephine Chu What are U.S. tariffs and who pays them? Tariffs are import duties on goods coming into the U.S., so American companies and other businesses buying directly from foreign suppliers will pick up the initial tab. Who bears the ultimate burden evolves, however, as businesses in the supply chain factor in new prices and their own demand. Importers wanting to limit the hit from tariffs can raise their prices, effectively passing along the tariff burden to American consumers and other businesses. But pain can be felt in the other direction too as American importers may decrease orders for newly tariffed imports that they can no longer afford. What sorts of goods and countries will be affected? Firms will have to pay additional 10% tariffs on all items they import to the U.S., from small, everyday items like cereal from Mexico, to large, expensive goods like Volkswagen cars from Germany. Since the duties vary by country, some goods will be affected much more than others. Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Laos will face some of the highest \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d of 46%, 44% and 48%, respectively. China, one the U.S.\u2019s largest trading partners, will face an additional tariff rate of 34%. Cargo trucks lining up in March to cross into the U.S. from Tijuana, Mexico. Why is Trump using tariffs? Trump says tariffs will help protect American businesses, move manufacturing to the U.S. and create jobs for American workers. He has also argued that tariffs would help narrow the U.S. trade deficit\u2014the gap between how much the country imports and exports. Many economists have been critical of Trump\u2019s use of tariffs, warning that they are too blunt a tool for protecting the U.S. economy and addressing trade imbalances. They also argue that tariffs could raise prices on a host of goods for American consumers and businesses. Trump has also turned to tariffs to extract political concessions from U.S. trading partners. After his threats to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico earlier this year, both countries pledged to step up border-control efforts to curb migration and illegal drug flow into the U.S. The idea of tariffs has resonated with swaths of Trump\u2019s political base. How might tariffs affect American consumers and businesses? Trump\u2019s latest tariff announcement sent U.S. stock futures lower, with some investors worried about the prospect of slower growth and higher inflation. Prior to Wednesday, there had already been fears that more tariffs would help push the American economy into a recession. The announcement gives some clarity to businesses, including those that rely on imported goods, although the broad and complex nature of the new tariff regime will take firms time to figure out. Many economists have been adamant that tariffs will push up prices for American consumers, as firms pass along some of the additional costs. BlueBay Asset Management firm, a unit of RBC Global Asset Management, estimated that the new tariffs will push U.S. inflation up 1%. It said economic growth will likely slow to 1.5% but that the U.S. probably wouldn\u2019t fall into recession. Even before Trump\u2019s tariff announcement, American families had already started to pull back spending. Sales have started to soften for airlines and convenience stores. Automakers and parts manufacturers have said they were likely to pass some of the tariff costs on to consumers. Morgan Stanley estimates that, on average, vehicle prices could rise 11% to 12% to offset duties. Many economists believe tariffs will raise prices on a host of goods for U.S. consumers and businesses. This explanatory article may be periodically updated. Write to Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com Corrections & Amplifications Some nations will be hit with tariffs higher than the 10% across-the-board rate that President Trump announced Wednesday. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that further duties will apply on some nations\u2019 goods after the 10%. (Corrected on April 2)",

The rapidly spiralling tariff war, which has given some American importers pause about purchases from China, has left exporters like her in limbo. When the US hiked duties on Chinese imports by 10 per cent in February and then doubled these in March, her American buyer held off on having the toys shipped in the hope that \u201cmaybe tariffs would come down\u201d later on, she said. But instead, that price tag is set to balloon, with levies to spike by another 34 per cent from April 9. \u201cImporters definitely have no way of accepting this,\u201d the 35-year-old sales director at Qinfeng Toys told The Straits Times. The tariff-induced limbo puts pressure on her company\u2019s storage space and finances, she said. It will not get paid until after the goods are shipped out \u2013 and when that will happen is still an open question. Qinfeng\u2019s factory churns out a swathe of playthings, from teddy bear baby mats to googly-eyed bath toys, in China\u2019s toy-making capital of Chenghai, Guangdong. The toys are priced from 10 yuan to 40 yuan (S$1.90 to S$7.40) each at the factory. Qinfeng is one of more than 50,000 toy companies located in the district in Shantou city. The industry employs about a third of the population there, local media reported in December. jytoy - Baby play mats produced by Qinfeng Toys in Shantou, China.

One of Ms Wong\u2019s American buyers had in February asked that the tax be split evenly between them \u2013 a proposition she accepted. When levies further increased in March, her customer was too embarrassed to propose any further cost-sharing and quickly proceeded with the shipment, she said. \u201cWe know it is also not easy for customers,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) our factory\u2019s profit margins are also not much... we also have to feed our workers.\u201d She added that some other toymakers had buyers who sought to slash prices or even cancel orders when shipments were already on the way. Looking ahead, Ms Wong said she was worried that with the latest tariff hikes, orders from the US market might \u201cshrivel up\u201d this year. She estimated that American buyers account for between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of her company\u2019s sales. Already, she said, her factory\u2019s total orders in 2025 were down about 10 per cent from the same period in 2024, as buyers looked to suppliers in South-east Asia and India amid tariff worries and geopolitical tensions. She was also concerned for her factory\u2019s 100 or so employees, as fewer orders meant shorter shifts and lower salaries for the workers, who are paid by the hour. Asked about her next steps, Ms Wong said she would look to sell more in other markets, including in South-east Asia and to Chinese domestic buyers. \u201cRight now, there is nothing that anyone can do,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the one hand, we wait and see, and on the other, we open up (other) markets.\u201d More on this Topic Are Trump\u2019s tariffs a recipe for strategic failure in Asia? From Lululemon gear to AirPods, S-E Asia\u2019s role in global supply chains put at risk by Trump tariffs Malaysian cereal snack exporter had just cracked the US market KUALA LUMPUR \u2013 Malaysian food company NIMS Adeliciousz was founded only in 2019 but managed to make inroads into the US market in 2023. It was a huge breakthrough for the young firm as the US is \u201ca market with high growth potential\u201d for its cereal-based snack Chocotub, said its chief executive Tengku Norhanim Tengku Othman, as evidenced by its monthly 20-foot container shipment to the US. However, it now has to wrestle with the question that all exporters to the US are facing \u2013 whether to absorb the added cost or pass it on to the consumer, in the wake of the latest US tariffs. The Trump administration has slapped a 24 per cent tariff across all Malaysian imports \u2013 except certain semiconductors \u2013 effective from April 9. \u201cIf we absorb the added cost, our profit margins will shrink, limiting our ability to invest in marketing and expansion,\u201d Ms Norhanim, 34, who is known as Kak Nim in the local industry, told The Straits Times. \u201cIn the short term, we anticipate a slight decline in US sales volume if we adjust our pricing in response to the tariff increase. However, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of the US market, as we continue to build strong branding and optimise costs,\u201d she added. Her company, which employs 50 workers, has a factory in Klang, Selangor, as well as two distribution centres, in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, and Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. To mitigate risks, she said, her company will pursue a two-pronged strategy by focusing on expanding its Asean footprint over the next two years \u201cbefore aggressively pursuing further growth in the US and European markets\u201d. jytariff05 - Kak Nim at a trade fair in New York on July 1, 2024.

Small businesses like NIMS are hoping they will be exempted from the 24 per cent import duties if they export only a modest amount of goods to the US. While small Malaysian businesses may fret, a giant like Top Glove \u2013 the world\u2019s largest glovemaker with an annual capacity of 50 billion pairs \u2013 believes it can grow its share of the US market, which already accounts for a quarter of its global exports. It faces a lower tariff rate than its glove-producing competitors in countries such as Vietnam (46 per cent), Thailand (36 per cent), China (54 per cent, including earlier tariffs in 2025), and Indonesia (32 per cent). \u201cWe believe this will generally augur well for the company. However, as developments are still in the early stages, we will continue to monitor the situation and assess the full impact of the tariffs in the coming months. We also anticipate increased competition in non-US markets, particularly Europe, as global trade dynamics shift,\u201d it said in an April 4 response on the tariffs. Nonetheless, Top Glove also noted concerns by the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association regarding the wider industry\u2019s ability to weather the tariff impact and the call for emergency support measures from the government. Malaysian glovemakers are also keeping fingers crossed for exemptions. Just as how Indian pharmaceutical companies heaved a sigh of relief after escaping the tariffs, Malaysian glovemakers are hoping that their key role in healthcare will be considered. satopglove25 - The advanced production line at a Top Glove factory in Selangor, Malaysia.

However, as developments are still in the early stages, we will continue to monitor the situation and assess the full impact of the tariffs in the coming months. We also anticipate increased competition in non-US markets, particularly Europe, as global trade dynamics shift,\u201d it said in an April 4 response on the tariffs. Nonetheless, Top Glove also noted concerns by the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association regarding the wider industry\u2019s ability to weather the tariff impact and the call for emergency support measures from the government. Malaysian glovemakers are also keeping fingers crossed for exemptions. Just as how Indian pharmaceutical companies heaved a sigh of relief after escaping the tariffs, Malaysian glovemakers are hoping that their key role in healthcare will be considered. satopglove25 - The advanced production line at a Top Glove factory in Selangor, Malaysia.

Pawan Kumar was going through on April 3. A tariff-laden tempest had hit the 52-year-old all the way from the White House in the US, threatening to upend his shrimp export business based over 13,000km away in Visakhapatnam in the coastal Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Hours earlier, US President Donald Trump had imposed a 26 per cent \u201creciprocal tariff\u201d on all Indian imports into the US effective from April 9, sending aftershocks across sectors from jewellery to electronics in India. Piled on with pre-existing anti-dumping and countervailing duties of around 9 per cent on Indian shrimps, Mr Kumar\u2019s exports to the US were suddenly looking at total steep tariffs of around 35 per cent, the kind he had \u201cnever seen anything like\u201d in his around 25-year career in the seafood industry. \u201cNo business runs on a 35 per cent margin,\u201d said Mr Kumar, managing director of Sprint Exports Private Limited. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to talk about it (the impact from the US tariffs), but all I can say is that it\u2019s going to affect us very badly.\u201d More than half of Sprint\u2019s global shrimp exports go to the US, with retail prices that can range from US$3 to US$9 (S$4 to S$12) for a pound (0.45kg). The firm ships around 6.4 million kg each year worldwide. The tariffs have hit not just Sprint but also the wider Indian shrimp industry. Around 40 per cent of Indian frozen shrimp exports are destined for the US, its biggest buyer. In financial year 2024, US$2.34 billion worth of these crustaceans were shipped to the US, accounting for over 90 per cent of Indian seafood exports of 297,571 tonnes to the country. Besides worry about the long-term prospects of his business, there is also confusion about how to find a way out of this tariff tangle in the immediate future. For instance, Mr Kumar is not sure if his shipments already in transit to the US will be subject to these new tariffs and if they are, whether he or the importer will have to foot the bill. And what does one do about the cargo that is ready to be shipped at pre-\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff rates or future contracts that were agreed to two to three months in advance? \u201cNow I don\u2019t know whether I should buy raw material or not for my existing orders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in a mixed-bag kind of thing. Not only me, all the exporters are in the same stage.\u201d More on this Topic \u2018Frightening\u2019: US restaurants, producers face tariff whiplash Trump\u2019s tariffs risk driving record food costs in the US even higher Mr Kumar, who is also president of the Seafood Exporters Association of India, spent much of April 3 tracking his shipments to the US, which take around 45 days to arrive from India, and speaking with Indian government representatives and other exporters to see how best to deal with the challenge. There are concerns American consumers may move away from Indian shrimp to cheaper options, such as those imported from Ecuador, a key competitor that has emerged luckier with a lower tariff of 10 per cent. Diversifying to other global markets is not going to be easy for Sprint or the wider Indian shrimp export industry because of their heavy reliance on the US market. \u201cFinding a market for 40 per cent is not all that easy\u2026 overnight, you can\u2019t replace that kind of market,\u201d said Mr Kumar. The options, for now, seem to be limited. Indian exporters such as Mr Kumar will have to pass on the costs to American consumers. \u201cBecause as an exporter I can\u2019t take that kind of hit,\u201d he added. Indonesian coffee exporter eyes EU and Japan markets instead JAKARTA \u2013 Veteran coffee exporter Irfan Anwar, whose company counts the US as its biggest market, does not need caffeine to keep him awake, as he has spent sleepless nights pondering the ramifications of the recent tariffs on Indonesia\u2019s imports into America. The 44-year-old managing partner of FnB Tech, which exports robusta, arabica and speciality coffees sourced from Sumatra to 125 countries worldwide, said his company has a shipment arriving in the US after the latest tariffs kick in from April 9. \u201cWe are currently negotiating with our partners to determine who will bear the additional cost \u2013 the buyer or the exporter. I predict it will take around three months to resolve the tariff-related issues for Indonesian coffee exporters,\u201d he said. Indonesian coffee exports to the US will be hurt by the steep 32 per cent levy on imports, which will result in much uncertainty over coffee prices, denting demand even as consumers drink less java. Mr Irfan, who is also chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industries, noted that Starbucks\u2019 stock price has taken a hit, in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s reciprocal tariffs. Shares of the Seattle-based company, which has the largest coffeehouse chain in the world, ended down 7 per cent on April 4, and 11 per cent lower for the year to date. \u201cStarbucks shares have declined, most likely because it sources all its coffee beans from overseas, including Indonesia,\u201d he said. The US chain, which has about 35,000 stores globally, sources its coffee beans from Sumatra and Sulawesi Toraja, among other places, according to its website. jytariff05 - Irfan Anwar.

Going forward, FnB Tech will focus its efforts on exporting more to existing main markets in the EU and Japan, while exploring new markets in other countries, he said. Mr Irfan said his company has contacted the US Embassy in Jakarta to register its concerns, and has urged the Indonesian government to engage in diplomatic talks to address the impact of the new tariffs on Indonesia\u2019s export-reliant businesses. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked the government to take proactive measures on this issue,\u201d he added",

    "content": "SINGAPORE: A new task force set up to help businesses and workers tide through the recent tariffs imposed by the United States will focus on communication and information sharing, said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (Apr 8). For instance, it will gather information from private-sector representatives on the challenges that businesses are facing on the ground and how the government can support them. ADVERTISEMENT There are also expectations that jobs might be affected in the medium to long term given the possibility of a \u201cmajor restructuring\u201d of the economy, which is why union representatives are included in the task force, said Mr Gan who is chairing the task force. Announced by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during a ministerial statement in parliament on Tuesday, the task force will aim to help businesses and workers address immediate uncertainties, strengthen resilience and adapt to a new economic landscape. It will comprise Singapore\u2019s economic agencies, as well as the Singapore Business Federation, Singapore National Employers Federation and the National Trades Union Congress. Related: Trump tariffs: Singapore to form task force to help businesses and workers, says PM Wong Singapore firms brace for further uncertainty as Trump ignites widespread tariffs Mr Gan said the task force is still working out the details of its composition and key tasks ahead, adding that the government\u2019s main guiding principle is to be \u201cas transparent as possible\u201d. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWhen we know something important, we\u2019ll share with the population, with the businesses, with the workers, with the unions and with members (of parliament),\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t know yet. we\u2019ll tell you honestly we do not have the information yet\u201d. He added that it is still early days and the government will need time to get a better understanding and assessment of the tariffs\u2019 impact on the Singapore economy. At the same time, the government is reaching out to Singapore\u2019s trading partners to share information and its assessment of the situation, as well as find different ways of working together, said Mr Gan. CONCERNS ABOUT IMPACT OF TARIFFS Several members of parliament raised concerns about how the latest US tariffs will impact local businesses and consumers, while seeking more details on the task force. ADVERTISEMENT Nominated MP Mark Lee said Singapore businesses will likely have to contend with a drop in global demand, as well as margin erosion with clients already requesting supply chain partners to absorb part of the tariffs-induced cost shock. On top of that, Singapore firms that have adopted a \u201cChina Plus One strategy\u201d \u2013 which involves companies diversifying into other countries, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, to avoid US tariffs on goods from China \u2013 are now under renewed pressure to diversify even further. This will be a \u201ccostly and complex\u201d move for local firms, he said. With that, Mr Lee hopes the task force will look at near-term support measures to help firms in cash flow, relocating or re-shoring their supply chains, as well as take a longer-term view to seize new opportunities arising from shifts in global supply chains. Related: Trump tariffs: Singapore economy could be hit hard by trade slowdown but there may be a silver lining, say analysts CNA Explains: Trump's tariffs and what they mean for Asia In response, Mr Wong said the government has gathered similar feedback from businesses and is concerned about how the disruptions to firms and their operations might lead to a spillover impact on overall economic growth. ADVERTISEMENT \u201cThat is why we think their concerns have to be dealt with quickly so DPM Gan\u2019s task force will continue to engage businesses to better understand the full extent of the impact because this situation is still unfolding, and eventually work out what additional measures we need,\u201d said Mr Wong. Noting that US tariffs could be imposed on the semiconductor industry, Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) asked about the impact such tariffs would have on jobs and growth. Mr Gan said the potential tariffs on the semiconductor industry are \u201csomething \u2026 of great concern\u201d given how Singapore\u2019s semiconductor exports to the US make up about 8.9 per cent of Singapore\u2019s total goods exports to the US. This is equivalent to 0.8 per cent of Singapore\u2019s total goods exports to the world last year \u2013 an amount that is \u201cnot insignificant\u201d, said the minister. The government has been engaging the semiconductor industry and will continue doing so, said Mr Gan. ADVERTISEMENT MPs, such as Mr Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang), also raised questions about trade negotiations with the US. Mr Liang wanted to know if the government continues to have access to key US officials for negotiations on tariffs, and whether the latest move by the US might affect other bilateral initiatives. In his reply, Mr Wong said Singapore will \u201cactively engage\u201d members of the US administration to better understand their concerns about the trade relationship between both countries, \u201caddress any misperceptions\u201d and discuss the best way forward. \u201cOf course, if the US decides that the baseline rate is universal across all countries, then it\u2019s a different consideration altogether,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not bilateral; it\u2019s their view of the world and they have decided that every country should at least have a 10 per cent tariff, but we are continuing to have these conversations with the US administration, and also with other countries.\u201d ADVERTISEMENT The tariffs, announced by US President Donald Trump on Apr 2, impose a universal 10 per cent tariff on all imports into the country, with higher rates for countries deemed to have treated the US \"unfairly\". Singapore, which currently imposes zero tariffs on US imports, is subject to the baseline 10 per cent rate. On other aspects of Singapore\u2019s relationship with the US, Mr Wong noted that both countries have built up a \u201cclose relationship\u201d over many decades in areas such as security and defence. These will be maintained, alongside discussions for new cooperation in areas like new technologies and energy. \u201cSo, these areas of cooperation remain, and we certainly want to continue advancing them as well,\u201d said Mr Wong.",

    "content": "The new U.S. tariffs rattling markets and promising globe-spanning trade barriers reflect a fixation of President Trump\u2019s: the difference between how much stuff the U.S. buys from and sells to each of its trading partners. The White House laid out new tariffs on more than 200 countries in two main ways. For more than half, it imposed a flat reciprocal tariff of 10%. For the rest, it added an additional levy based on a basic formula. In these instances, the Trump administration determined costs it said countries imposed by taking the amount of a nation\u2019s 2024 goods-trade imbalance with the U.S., then dividing that by the value of the goods America imports from that nation. A White House handout called these costs a tariff charged to the U.S., \u201cIncluding Current Manipulation and Trade Barriers.\u201d From there, in nearly all cases, the Trump administration imposed new \u201cDiscounted Reciprocal Tariffs\u201d of roughly half that result. \u201cDrop your trade barriers\u2026and start buying tens of billions of dollars of American goods,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. Several economists said that basing tariffs off of bilateral goods deficits is confusing and illogical. Learning of the tariff formula \u201cwas like watching a movie, and at the end of it, you\u2019re like, \u2018That\u2019s it?\u2019\u201d said David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. Beckworth said a more holistic approach would have taken services trade into account, too\u2014like tech and education the U.S. sells to foreigners. Unlike with goods, America has run an overall services trade surplus for decades, including with most of the nations receiving reciprocal tariffs. Goods deficits are a normal feature of healthy trade and \u201cdo not imply that anything is wrong,\u201d said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Take a relatively poor country that mostly exports coffee to the U.S. Its citizens might lack the wealth to buy the kinds of high-value goods, such as Boeing aircraft or Tesla SUVs, that American factories specialize in. But that is no reason to discourage that country\u2019s coffee from reaching American consumers\u2014especially because few places in America have the right climate to grow coffee domestically, Milesi-Ferretti said. The U.S. added reciprocal tariffs on several less-wealthy coffee exporters such as Guatemala and Honduras. The White House figures initially confused economists because they didn\u2019t seem to correspond with what foreign countries actually charge against imports from the U.S. For example, Chinese tariffs against the U.S. were about 23% overall as of last month, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The White House chart said China\u2019s tariffs and trade barriers were 67%. In response, the White House added new tariffs of 34% atop levies already charged to that country. Data sleuths on social media soon reverse-engineered the formula behind the White House\u2019s calculations, zeroing in on the trade-related math. Dividing the U.S.\u2019s 2024 goods-trade deficit with China\u2014$295 billion\u2014by the amount the U.S. imported from China resulted in the White House\u2019s 67%. The Wall Street Journal followed calculations highlighted in postings on social media, including by journalist James Surowiecki, a former business columnist for the New Yorker. The Journal found the calculations explained the costs attributed to nearly 100 countries, including all of the European Union, which the White House treated as a single bloc. In a post on its website Wednesday, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative blamed persistent trade deficits for the loss of manufacturing jobs. It said it calculated the tariff rates that would reduce trade deficits with specific countries to zero, rates it calls \u201creciprocal and fair.\u201d In justifying its math, the post cites a handful of research papers on tariffs and trade deficits. \u201cReciprocal tariffs are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the U.S. and each of our trading partners,\u201d the USTR said. Some of the researchers cited by USTR questioned the math and the basic premise that tariffs can reduce the trade deficit to zero, when reached by the Journal. Pau Pujolas, an economist at McMaster University in Canada, said tariffs don\u2019t generally do much to reduce trade deficits. Trade is complicated, and tariffs can have all sorts of unintended consequences. On the one hand, tariffs are likely to raise prices of imported goods. But if the economies and currencies of exporting countries take a hit as a result of tariffs, that may push the price of their export goods down again. \u201cWhat the tariffs do is simply impoverish your neighbor and make sure that you can import more cheaply,\u201d he said. Another economist cited, Purdue University\u2019s Anson Soderbery, said his paper \u201cwas entirely written to combat\u201d arguments like those made by the USTR. The USTR didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. His study found that in some cases, the benefits of tariffs can outweigh the costs. But the key is to carefully calculate which tariffs do more good than harm, rather than adding new tariffs in bulk on all countries that run a trade surplus with the U.S., Soderbery said. He said it shouldn\u2019t be the goal to get all trade deficits to zero. Imports can be beneficial because they free up U.S. workers to focus on more valuable work, like software engineering. \u201cDo we want to trade our high-tech, high-skilled-labor service industries for production of avocados?\u201d Soderbery said. \u201cWe can do it but I\u2019m not sure why we want to.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Billionaire businessman Elon Musk, one of President Trump\u2019s most visible and influential advisers, is leveling veiled critiques at the White House\u2019s trade agenda, exposing tensions within the administration over the president\u2019s far-reaching tariffs. On Monday morning, Musk posted a well-known video of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade by explaining how the component parts of a pencil require complex supply chains. That followed a weekend where Musk took aim at Trump\u2019s top trade adviser Peter Navarro, suggesting that his push for steep and broad-based trade barriers is wrongheaded. \u201cA PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,\u201d Musk posted in response to a user on X who lauded Navarro\u2019s education. Musk, who leads several companies, also implied that Navarro lacked hands-on experience in the economy. \u201cHe ain\u2019t built s\u2014,\u201d Musk wrote. Trump\u2019s new tariff policies have cratered stock markets and caused concerns over a global economic slowdown. The president has said Americans should expect short-term pain as he attempts to reshape the American economy to make it less dependent on foreign-made goods. Last week, Trump announced universal tariffs on nearly all the world\u2019s economies and imposed even steeper duties on many nations, erecting a towering trade barrier around the U.S. economy almost overnight. The moves have caused widespread confusion\u2014particularly over whether Trump is committed to keeping the plan in place for years to boost U.S. manufacturing or if he is using the new tariffs as a negotiating ploy to force other countries to change their policies. The extent of the confusion was made apparent Monday morning when a stray comment by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett was misconstrued to suggest that Trump might pause the tariffs for 90 days, sending markets upward briefly. The White House clarified that no change in policy was planned, prompting markets to go back down. The Trump administration\u2019s new 10% global tariffs went into effect on Saturday, subjecting virtually every nation to new duties. Photo: Claudio Giovannini/Zuma Press There are other indications that parts of Trump\u2019s coalition are souring on the White House. Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge-fund manager who backs Trump, called for a 90-day pause in the tariffs to negotiate with other countries, warning that the alternative was \u201ca self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\u201d \u201cWe are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,\u201d Ackman wrote on social media. Ackman singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, another Trump trade adviser, saying that he has a conflict of interest because of his investment strategy. \u201cHe profits when our economy implodes,\u201d Ackman wrote on social media. A Lutnick spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, top White House aides used different rationales to explain the purpose of the tariffs over the weekend. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted that the overall goal was to open a negotiation. \u201cHe has created maximum leverage for himself,\u201d said Bessent on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Bessent said more than 50 countries had approached the White House about lowering their trade barriers, suggesting that opening trade talks with other countries was a main objective. Lutnick took a harder line, saying on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d: \u201cWe got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.\u201d Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman called for a 90-day tariff pause to negotiate with other nations. Musk, over the weekend, floated the idea of a free-trade zone between the U.S. and Europe. \u201cI hope it\u2019s agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,\u201d Musk said, appearing virtually Saturday at a political rally in Italy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyden said Monday that Europe was ready to negotiate with the U.S. and offered \u201czero-for-zero\u201d tariffs on industrial goods. Navarro called it a \u201cgood start,\u201d but said countries must address \u201cnon-tariff cheating.\u201d Navarro told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Monday he hadn\u2019t yet spoken with Musk, but expected to at some point Monday at the White House. \u201cEverything is good with Elon,\u201d Navarro said, praising his work to cut government spending. He played down Musk\u2019s comments, suggesting that trade policy wasn\u2019t part of Musk\u2019s remit and explaining that within the administration his perspective was seen as that of a \u201ccar manufacturer\u201d and a \u201ccar assembler.\u201d Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, one of the world\u2019s largest makers of electric vehicles. \u201cHe is a car person,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he loves.\u201d Musk has made critical comments about White House priorities in the past, taking aim at a $500 billion venture involving billionaire Sam Altman\u2019s OpenAI to build data centers in the U.S. Musk questioned the endeavor shortly after Trump announced it, saying the companies didn\u2019t actually have the money. Trump brushed off the dust-up, explaining Musk\u2019s remarks as part of a personal feud between Musk and Altman. \u201cHe hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said.",

    "content": "The writer is a professor at Harvard University and former chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers A hopeful endgame for the tariff fiasco is making the rounds on Wall Street and in Washington. Donald Trump cuts quick deals with countries around the world, declares victory, and eliminates or dramatically reduces the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, leaving only the 10 per cent across-the-board ones plus miscellaneous others like steel and aluminium. The hope is that markets would cheer the certainty, businesses would return to planning for their futures, and everyone could turn their attention elsewhere. That this settlement would be viewed as a victory shows just how far and how quickly the Overton window \u2014 or policy ideas regarded as acceptable \u2014 has shifted to a tariff rate that would put the US on par with Iran and Venezuela. Consider that all of this started with an average tariff rate of 2.5 per cent in 2024, a rate that itself was elevated by the tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term and that Biden then added to. Most analysts \u2014 myself included \u2014 thought that market pressure would force Trump to scale back once he returned. Investment banks were bandying around scenarios like a 5 percentage point increase in the average tariff rate. We are now at a 24 per cent average tariff rate, making the US the highest tariff country in the world \u2014 leapfrogging pikers such as Iran and Venezuela with average rates of 12 and 14 per cent respectively. In fact, there is no country with a population above 1mn and a per capita income even a quarter as high as the US that has an average tariff rate above 10 per cent. Moreover, it is possible this could go even higher if full tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the promised tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other sectors happen, or if the US escalates further in response to foreign retaliation. More likely, however, is that Trump has been so burned by the hot stove that he\u2019ll pull his hand away. In the past, he has been able to make a big deal out of small concessions, and he may well end up doing that here. How exactly you negotiate deals with the 60 different economies currently facing \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on top of the 10 per cent across-the-board tariff is hard to imagine, but let\u2019s suppose that he pulls it off. While anything is possible, the most likely landing place is that he will retain the across-the-board tariff which he campaigned on and considers central to shifting the US revenue base, while maintaining a higher tariff on certain countries like China and certain products such as steel. The result would be that the US would have a 12 to 15 per cent average tariff rate. That is much lower than now \u2014 but still very high, with inevitably bad consequences. It is possible the market would breathe a sigh of relief that rates settled lower than they might have been otherwise, but that level would still result in a substantial reduction in the volume of imports and exports. Americans would face higher prices, lower quality and a shift to worse jobs in import substitution industries from the higher productivity export and service jobs they are in now. Moreover, even tariffs at this level would guarantee extremely high trade policy uncertainty for at least the next four years. When businesses are not sure what future policy will be, it can pay to wait until this is resolved before making big, irreversible investment decisions. The result is less investment and lower growth. Uncertainty does not work in the way often supposed, namely the chance that something bad will happen. Instead, it reflects variance in future outcomes \u2014 which could be tariff reductions or tariff increases. In the past 50 years, the average tariff rate has never changed by more than 1 percentage point in a single year. In most years, they have not changed by more than a tenth or two (although other trade restrictions that have changed over time, like quotas, are not captured by this measure). If the US were starting from an average tariff rate of say 12 per cent, even with a less erratic and more predictable president, businesses would have to scenario plan around a much wider range of tariff possibilities than they have faced in a very long time. Unfortunately, there is no real way out. Even if Trump backs down from his most extreme proposal he will have succeeded in shifting the debate on tariffs and in building uncertainty, which itself can act like a tariff. It will be hard to put the evil genie back in its bottle. The best option would be for Congress to take back the power to set tariffs \u2014 which would at least be more predictable than leaving them to the whims of one person.",

    "content": "\u201cThe era of rules-based globalization and free trade is over. We are entering a new phase\u2014one that is more arbitrary, protectionist, and dangerous.\u201d Looking somberly at the camera, Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had a grim warning to deliver to the island-nation last week. As a free trade entrep\u00f4t and financial node, Singapore has a lot to lose. But what is true for Singapore is doubly true for the rest of Southeast Asia. The region has been one of globalization\u2019s winners; export-led economies powered growth, which bought social peace. Now that has changed, and a looming economic crisis may spark a political reckoning, too. No other region in the world is as trade dependent as Southeast Asia. In 2022, the collective trade-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio of countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) stood at 106.2 percent, a hair ahead of the European Union at 103.6 percent. But it gets worse: 80.8 percent of its exports are goods, the class of export that President Donald Trump is most fixated on, given his hallucinations of U.S. industrial revival. The United States is ASEAN\u2019s second-largest export market after China, receiving about a fifth of its goods. Importantly, though, manufactured products make up the overwhelming majority of goods exported. Now every single ASEAN country has been slapped with brutal tariffs: Cambodia with 49 percent, Laos 48 percent, Vietnam 46 percent, Thailand 36 percent, Indonesia 32 percent, Malaysia 24 percent, Brunei 24 percent, Philippines 17 percent, and Singapore 10 percent. Trump claimed his tariffs were \u201creciprocal,\u201d but they were calculated not based on other countries\u2019 tariffs but using a simple formula in which the higher a nation\u2019s trade surplus with the United States, the greater the punishment. The brutal logic, insofar as there is any, to Trump\u2019s tariffs is on full display the more a country sells to the United States\u2014especially if it is too poor to purchase many U.S. products. The shock to the region is hard to overstate. When Trump returned to office, many in the region were rather pleased. While tariffs were expected, these had been a major feature\u2014by normal standards\u2014of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, too. There was a belief that China tariffs might even represent an opportunity. Many manufacturers had already relocated operations from China to Southeast Asia in response to U.S. tariffs. More fundamentally, many retained the belief that Trump was ultimately a pragmatic businessman, prone to saying outrageous things but ultimately open to deals and free of Democratic canting about democracy. \u201cHe [Trump] is always pro-business,\u201d former Singaporean Foreign Minister George Yeo confidently declared at a February business summit in Jakarta. \u201cIn all his actions, he has one eye on the stock market. \u2026 If it stays down too long, he will switch.\u201d Now Trump is making Yeo, and many others in foreign capitals and on Wall Street, eat those words. Apparently unmoved by the stock market turmoil, Trump declared on Sunday that \u201csometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\u201d Despite it all, the idea that there is still a deal to be struck guides ASEAN\u2019s response. While China has punched back, slapping 34 percent tariffs on U.S. goods, the response of ASEAN has been to look to appease Trump. Vietnam has gone furthest, offering to drop all tariffs on U.S. goods. Cambodia has proposed slashing tariffs on U.S. goods to 5 percent. Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia have refrained from initial action but are all gearing up for rapid negotiations. Meanwhile, the Philippines\u2014America\u2019s only treaty ally in the bloc\u2014is also proposing cutting tariffs on U.S. goods. \u201cNot retaliating is the overall strategy from ASEAN countries, hoping Trump will be willing to make exceptions,\u201d said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a co-founder of the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia. \u201cTrump is committed to protect the U.S. market, but like the Godfather, he\u2019ll likely be more generous to those willing to kiss the ring. As [Southeast Asia] is the epicenter of U.S.-China rivalry, Trump will probably not want to push the region completely into the China orbit. But some kowtowing will be required.\u201d Whether this will work, though, is doubtful. \u201cThis is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that\u2019s gotten out of control because of cheating,\u201d Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade advisor who is said to have designed the tariffs, told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cDon\u2019t say you want to lower the tariffs and be done with it. It\u2019s the non-tariff cheating. Stop manipulating your currencies. Stop dumping stuff in.\u201d Still, ASEAN has few other good options. Its economies are just simply not large enough to slug it out toe-to-toe with the United States in a trade war, as China seems prepared to do. In 2023, total regional GDP stood at 3.8 trillion\u2014about a fifth of China\u2019s. Besides, there is no guarantee that ASEAN will move in concert. For now, there are some attempts to coordinate efforts. But the temptation to cut separate deals will be strong, if at all possible, especially as different countries face different levels of exposure. Massively trade-dependent Vietnam and Cambodia are eager for a deal as fast as possible. Indonesia will feel the urgency, too, but with its large domestic market and relatively low trade dependency, the issue is less sharp. Meanwhile, the Philippines is slyly suggesting that the tariffs could actually help its economy\u2014its rate, after all, is \u201conly\u201d 17 percent. As a result, ASEAN is facing an extremely dangerous time not just economically but politically. For decades, the region\u2019s governments have tied their political models to globalization\u2014trade fueling growth that in turn buys social peace. The last time the region saw as major a shock to this model was during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. That period saw a military junta toppled in Thailand, Indonesia\u2019s dictatorship tumble, and a bout of brutal political infighting in Malaysia. Today\u2019s economic crisis could spawn political crises just as dramatic.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 10% baseline tariffs on US trading partners around the world came into effect on Saturday. While the baseline charge has kicked in, higher duties on some countries \u2014 which replace, rather than add to the 10% rate \u2014 are due to start on April 9. Here\u2019s how the region is responding: Australia Reciprocal Tariff: 10% Response: Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the US tariff a \u201cpoor decision\u201d and said he would not respond with reciprocal levies. The nation also won\u2019t take action via the World Trade Organization at this stage. Bangladesh Reciprocal Tariff: 37% Response: Bangladesh said it is looking to hold talks with the Trump administration to lessen the impact, particularly on the country\u2019s $40 billion garment export industry. Brunei Reciprocal Tariff: 24% Response: The finance ministry said it\u2019s engaging with its US counterparts to seek clarifications on the new tariffs, according to the Borneo Bulletin. Cambodia Reciprocal Tariff: 49% Response: The government said there is an immediate reduction of tariffs on 19 categories of American goods to 5% from 35%, without identifying the products. It is seeking talks with the US and has asked Trump to delay the tariffs due to take effect on April 9. China Reciprocal Tariff: 34% Response: China retaliated and will impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10. it also announced other measures including immediately restricting the exports of seven types of rare earths; halting imports of poultry products from two American companies and imposing export controls on 16 US firms. Hong Kong Reciprocal Tariff: China\u2019s 34% tariffs also apply to Hong Kong, whose special trading privileges were removed by a Trump executive order in 2020. Response: Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the city won\u2019t impose countermeasures on the US, Radio Television Hong Kong reported. Hong Kong should remain \u201cfree and open,\u201d he said. Fiji Reciprocal Tariff: 32% Response: The Fijian government said it was engaging with the US through diplomatic and trade channels to seek clarity on the measures and explore options to mitigate their impact. In particular, it\u2019s questioning the US\u2019s methodology for calculating tariffs, which include currency manipulation and non-tariff trade barriers. India Reciprocal Tariff: 26% Response: India is unlikely to immediately retaliate, and is focusing efforts on negotiating a bilateral trade deal with the US to bring down duties, according to an Indian government official. Indonesia Reciprocal Tariff: 32% Response: A delegation will head to Washington to negotiate the tariffs. President Prabowo Subianto ordered his cabinet to simplify regulations, including by easing non-tariff barriers. Indonesia is also in talks with Malaysia, which is the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to jointly take steps in addressing the tariffs, the government said. Japan Reciprocal Tariff: 24% Response: Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is seeking a phone call with Trump this week to discuss the tariffs. \u201cRetaliating by imposing tariffs of our own is not what\u2019s in Japan\u2019s interests,\u201d he said on a television program, adding \u201cthere are many options.\u201d Kazakhstan Reciprocal Tariff: 27% Response: The government is initiating talks with the US \u201cto discuss possibilities to not apply the additional tariffs,\u201d the trade ministry said. Malaysia Reciprocal Tariff: 24% Response: Malaysia is not considering retaliatory tariffs. The country\u2019s response will be \u201ccalm, firm and guided by Malaysia\u2019s national interests,\u201d and efforts were already underway to engage the US, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said. The country, as the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will lead efforts to coordinate a regional response toward US tariffs, he said. Anwar said he\u2019d spoken with several Asean leaders and will reach out to those in North Asia, too. Myanmar Reciprocal Tariff: 44% Response: Myanmar is considering some measures to address the new tariffs, according to Deputy Commerce Minister Min Min, without provide any details. Officials are currently focused on relief and reconstruction after last month\u2019s massive earthquake, he said. New Zealand Reciprocal Tariff: 10% Response: Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said New Zealand won\u2019t launch reciprocal tariffs against the US, in part as it would add to inflation . Pakistan Reciprocal Tariff: 29% Response: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the government will send a high-level mission to Washington for talks, and is currently analyzing the impact and looking at the way forward. Philippines Reciprocal Tariff: 17% Response: There has been no mention of a retaliatory response. Trade Secretary Cristina Roque said she is seeking to meet with her US counterpart to discuss improving ties and is pushing for a bilateral free trade agreement. Singapore Reciprocal Tariff: 10% Response: Its leaders said the country won\u2019t retaliate even though it is able to do so under a free-trade agreement, and will seek talks. South Korea Reciprocal Tariff: 25% Response: South Korea\u2019s interim leader Han Duck-soo said the government aims to send its trade minister to the US for negotiations as soon as possible. Sri Lanka Reciprocal Tariff: 44% Response: President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a committee that included the treasury secretary and central bank governor to study the potential issues from the new reciprocal tariff system and submit recommendations to the government. Taiwan Reciprocal Tariff: 32% Response: President Lai Ching-te said Taiwan doesn\u2019t plan to retaliate with tariffs, and will make efforts to improve the reciprocal tariffs through talks with the US. Taiwan-US talks can start from \u201czero tariffs,\u201d and industries such as electronics, petrochemicals and natural gas will seek to boost investments in the US, according to the presidential office. The island earlier called the tariffs unreasonable and announced NT$88 billion ($2.7 billion) in aid to help local companies cope with the impact of new tariffs. Thailand Reciprocal Tariff: 36% Response: Deputy Prime Minister Pichai Chunhavajira will visit the US in the coming days, the government said. Proposals to US officials will include raising imports of US energy, aviation products and agricultural goods and suppressing the use of Thailand as a transit point for goods heading to the US. Vietnam Reciprocal Tariff: 46% Response: Vietnam has offered to remove all tariffs on US imports. Communist Party chief To Lam has asked that the US not apply any additional tariffs or fees on Vietnamese goods and requested the postponement of the implementation of tariffs by at least 45 days after April 9. Others Here\u2019s a list of other nations and territories in the Asia Pacific that are facing US tariffs. All are charged at 10% unless otherwise stated. Most have yet to comment officially on the tariffs. Afghanistan Azerbaijan Bhutan Christmas Island, a non-self-governing external territory of Australia Cocos (Keeling) Islands, an Australian external territory with a population of 600 people Cook Islands French Polynesia Heard and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian external territory Kiribati Kyrgyzstan Laos at 48% Maldives Marshall Islands Micronesia Mongolia Nauru at 30% Nepal Norfolk Island at 29% Papua New Guinea Samoa Solomon Islands Tajikistan Timor-Leste Tokelau, a dependent territory of New Zealand Tonga Turkmenistan Tuvalu Uzbekistan Vanuatu at 22% North Korea is among a handful of nations globally that have been exempted from the latest tariffs.",

    "content": "For weeks, as the contours of President Trump\u2019s sweeping tariff plans came in and out of focus, Wall Street\u2019s big names kept any concerns they had to themselves. Now, after a two-day market meltdown last week that erased trillions in value from U.S. stocks, some are speaking out, including those who have been vocal supporters of Trump. Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge-fund manager behind Pershing Square, called for a 90-day pause in the tariffs to negotiate with other countries, warning that the alternative was \u201ca self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\u201d \u201cWe are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,\u201d Ackman wrote in a social-media post on X. U.S. stock futures tumbled Sunday night when trading reopened, and markets in Asia plunged, setting up Monday to be another bleak day. President Trump skipped the normal monthslong process to impose tariffs and instead used a 1970s law to bypass them. WSJ\u2019s Gavin Bade explains what that means legally and what Congress might do about it. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Howard Marks, co-chairman of investment firm Oaktree Capital, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from free trade and world trade and globalization to this system, which implies significant restrictions on trade in every direction and a step toward isolation for the United States.\u201d Stan Druckenmiller, the investor and lifelong Republican who was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\u2019s boss at George Soros\u2019s hedge fund, sent a rare post on X, making clear his opposition to the administration\u2019s tariff plan: \u201cI do not support tariffs exceeding 10%.\u201d Hedge-fund manager Dan Loeb pointed to Druckenmiller\u2019s and Marks\u2019s comments on his X feed. He said there were conceptual and practical errors in the policy announced last week, adding, \u201cIt will be a test of the administration\u2019s judgment versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days.\u201d During the first Trump administration, a number of senior financial executives had regular and open conversations with Trump and others, sharing views and advice. Comparable channels and discussions aren\u2019t happening this time around, according to people close to the matter. Still, some financial executives have shared concerns about the tariffs with senior White House officials including Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Bessent, and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, one person familiar with the discussions said. The Trump team was in listening mode for those conversations, the person said. Those bank CEOs could face pressure to speak out publicly starting this week when they begin reporting quarterly results and investors will see if they issue critiques of their own. President Trump spoke to reporters outside the White House as he left for Florida for the weekend, a day after unveiling sweeping new tariffs. Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images For much of the weekend, traders remained stunned at the extent of the tariffs unveiled by Trump, and by the market\u2019s subsequent reaction. \u201cLiberation Day was a knock-down, drag-out affair,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019s Tony Pasquariello, who leads the firm\u2019s hedge-fund coverage team, wrote to clients Saturday morning. \u201cThere was a harshness that surprised even the most hawkish people I know.\u201d Some financial executives held out hope that Republicans in Congress would exert pressure on the Trump administration to postpone tariffs on countries that are negotiating with the U.S. to lower tariffs. Others suggested that it was wrong to blame Trump for the deep losses of investors. \u201cWhile the Trump Administration is responsible for wringing the froth out of the market, it was not responsible for putting it in there,\u201d argued Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s policy approach has been well advertised since prior to the election.\u201d The market could rebound if Trump and his team cut deals with various nations to reduce tariffs and improve terms of trade, some Wall Street analysts argued. \u201cWith nations seeking to cut deals with the Administration\u2026the President is well positioned to start claiming some victories\u2014he just needs to want to seize them,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. But many in finance were perplexed with indications over the weekend from Trump and others that they didn\u2019t appear eager to reach deals to forestall the coming tariffs\u2014and that some members of the administration didn\u2019t seem especially concerned that stocks are getting hammered. \u201cWe believe that Wall Street and Main Street prosper and suffer together,\u201d Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, told clients in a note Sunday evening. \u201cThe Trump administration disagrees.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON - Singapore has more options than most nations in how it responds to US President Donald Trump\u2019s universal tariffs that are now in force. As a free trade partner, Singapore can rightfully ask for exemption from Mr Trump\u2019s unilateral imposition of 10 per cent \u201cbaseline\u201d tariffs that violate the letter and spirit of the 2004 US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, say US-based analysts and former diplomats. Additionally, Singapore can look at new opportunities that may open up as a result of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that kick in on April 9. Singapore faces significantly lower tariffs compared with China (at more than 54 per cent), Vietnam (46 per cent) or even the European Union (20 per cent). This would keep Singaporean exports \u2013 like electronics, pharmaceuticals and chemicals \u2013 more price-competitive in the US market. An implication is that Singapore could be perceived by large multinational companies as a relatively low-risk investment destination amid global trade turbulence. In a curious way, it could even cement Singapore\u2019s status as a trade hub. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will speak in Parliament on US tariffs and their implications for Singapore at 1pm on April 8. Veteran American trade experts told The Straits Times that America\u2019s oldest FTA partner in Asia has been treated unfairly. That said, Singapore does figure in the bottom-most 10 per cent tier of Mr Trump\u2019s tariffs. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many others in Asia, outside of Australia, that are in that position,\u201d said Mr William Reinsch, at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). So what would Singapore, a small and open trade-faring nation, say to the world\u2019s largest economy that has made a sharp break from its historic role as a promoter of free trade to a builder of a wall of tariffs? \u201cThe argument I would use would be that FTA partners ought to be treated the way the FTA requires them to be treated,\u201d Mr Reinsch said, who has also served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents multinational companies on international trade and tax policy issues. Singapore applies zero tariffs on US products, as long as they qualify as originating goods under the FTA\u2019s rules of origin. The exception is Singapore\u2019s goods and services tax, which applies to both imported and domestic goods, at the rate of 9 per cent. And certain goods like alcohol and tobacco face excise taxes. \u201cThe concept of a free trade agreement was zero tariffs in both directions. And we, by and large, have that with our FTA partners,\u201d Mr Reinsch noted. \u201cI would be coming back to the United States and saying: we have these agreements, and the agreements involve zero tariffs. So your 10 per cent is presumably for compensating for non-tariff barriers. But you haven\u2019t actually identified those barriers or labelled them or made any effort to adjust your algorithm or your formula to take into account the actual amount of those barriers. \u201cSo I would push back and argue that free trade agreement partners ought to be exempt and ought to stay at zero,\u201d he added, cautioning that negotiations will be tough.

The US has comprehensive FTAs with 20 countries including Australia, South Korea and Israel. During a visit to Washington on April 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will drop trade barriers to erase its trade deficit with the US. But it was not enough to immediately earn a reprieve from the 17 per cent tariff that Mr Trump has levied on the US\u2019 oldest FTA partner. South Korea, which faces 26 per cent tariffs, is sending its Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo to Washington for talks starting April 8. If it indeed does so, Singapore would be joining at least 70 other nations \u2013 including China, Japan and Vietnam \u2013 that the White House says are wanting to talk tariffs. \u201cMost of the negotiations are going to be between the United States and countries that are well above 10 per cent and they\u2019ll be focused on getting them down as close to 10 as they can,\u201d noted Mr Reinsch. \u201cGetting them below 10 is, I think, unrealistic,\u201d he said. The conundrum for Singapore is that there are no particular trade barriers or problems, so in that sense there is nothing to \u201csolve\u201d, said Mr Frank Lavin, a former US ambassador to Singapore who had helped negotiate the 2004 FTA that resulted in bilateral trade and investment growing significantly in both directions. But the Trump administration could be amenable to talks, given its penchant for cutting deals. \u201cI would note that the current administration also places a priority on the public dimension and symbolism of these issues, so my one piece of advice would be to send a Cabinet-level official to meet with the US Commerce Secretary for an overall review of the bilateral trade relationship. \u201cAn in-person meeting usually results in a lowering of temperature and a better understanding of issues,\u201d added Mr Lavin, who served as undersecretary for international trade at the Department of Commerce in the George H. W. Bush administration where he was the lead trade negotiator for both China and India. He is now a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution. US goods trade with Singapore totalled an estimated US$89.2 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. US goods exports to Singapore in the same year were US$46 billion, up 8.4 per cent (US$3.6 billion) from 2023. US goods imports from Singapore totalled US$43.2 billion in 2024, up 5.6 per cent (US$2.3 billion) from 2023. The US goods trade surplus with Singapore was US$2.8 billion in 2024, an 84.8 per cent increase (US$1.3 billion) over 2023. More on this Topic ST Explains: What Trump\u2019s tariffs are, and how they could affect growth in Singapore and more From Lululemon gear to AirPods, S-E Asia\u2019s role in global supply chains put at risk by Trump tariffs Mr Reinsch said Singapore can also turn the disadvantage of the 10 per cent tariff into its favour. \u201cAs we get into tariff arbitrage situations, Singapore is likely to be a beneficiary,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they should be aware of that and moving to take advantage of it.\u201d The Trump administration has dropped hints that more tariffs may be forthcoming on specific sectors like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, which are key exports from Singapore. These will roil global trade further. Still, multinational companies encountering higher tariffs on countries like China and Vietnam may choose to shift manufacturing to lower-tariffed nations. Viewed in this way, Singapore, with the 10 per cent tariff rate, robust infrastructure and stable business environment, becomes an attractive relocation destination. Companies already operating in Singapore, for example in the tech and pharma sectors, could expand their operations. Newer investments can also flow in, which would cement Singapore\u2019s existing role as a regional manufacturing and logistics hub. Within Asean, Singapore could emerge as a regional gateway for the grouping\u2019s exports to the US, thus boosting the volume of trade.",
