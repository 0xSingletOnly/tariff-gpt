Beijing sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s threats to impose an additional 50 percent tariff on China as “blackmail” Tuesday, ratcheting up the tensions between the world’s two largest economies amid a burgeoning trade war.

“The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. “China will never accept it. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.”

Despite concerns about a further escalation, markets in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe rebounded after Monday’s steep losses. Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained more than 6 percent during Tuesday trading, while Australia’s ASX 200 ended the day just over 2 percent higher, and South Korea’s KOSPI tentatively crossed into positive territory.

In Europe, exchanges in Britain, France and Germany all showed gains between 1 percent and 1.8 percent in early trading.

The Chinese government took several measures to stabilize stocks, boosting Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index — where many Chinese exporters are listed and which lost 13.2 percent on Monday, its worst day since the Asian financial crisis of 1997. It was poised to end Tuesday trading in positive territory. The Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes both closed slightly higher.

Some of those rebounds were investors recouping Monday’s losses. But they also reflected “slight glimmers of hope out of the U.S. that maybe there is some room for compromise,” said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist for HSBC.

That hope, however, was tempered by the worsening rhetoric between Trump and Beijing and rising chances of a global recession.

Trump threatened Monday to impose additional 50 percent tariffs on China if Beijing did not “withdraw” its retaliatory measures on Tuesday, a move that would take duties on Chinese-made goods to at least 104 percent — and in some cases more.

“Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”

Trump’s threat and China’s response marked a “very precarious new chapter for the trade war,” said Neumann, who put chances of a global recession at roughly 40 percent. “It means that the tariffs that were announced last week aren’t the upper ceiling, that they could be pushed much higher depending on how countries react.”

The reaction from Chinese state media Tuesday was defiant.

“The U.S. is wielding its tariff cudgel again,” said the People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, in a foreign affairs column. “China has the capacity and confidence to manage the shock.”

China’s response showed it is “willing to hold the line,” said Feng Chucheng, founding partner of Hutong Research, an independent consultancy in Beijing.

“This is not just a gesture to send a signal to Trump, but also to send a signal to the rest of the world that China is willing to put up a fight against this bullying behavior of Trump,” he said.

Chinese companies, meanwhile, rushed to boost confidence in the market amid trade uncertainty. Several state-run firms, including Central Huijin Investment, a unit of a Chinese sovereign wealth fund, have announced plans to increase Chinese stock holdings to maintain market stability, according to state media. China’s central bank also pledged to support Central Huijin’s move.

Andrew Collier, an expert on China’s economy at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that those purchases do nothing to change the Beijing’s underlying economic challenges.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping “is facing a lot of economic pressure domestically,” Collier said, including from a property sector crisis, which may push him to the negotiating table with Trump.

While China reacted defiantly to Trump’s blitz, other leaders across the Asia-Pacific region launched efforts to negotiate.

Trump signaled Monday that he was open to cutting deals with countries to ease tariffs, even as White House officials continued to suggest there would be no quick end to new import duties.

“We’re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don’t, we’re going to have nothing to do with them,” Trump said in an Oval Office appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “They’re not going to be allowed to participate in the United States.”

Countries including Israel, Taiwan and Vietnam have offered to drop their duties on goods from the United States as part of a deal to avert Trump’s tariffs from taking effect.

Some 50 to 70 countries have been in contact with the White House to negotiate, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba urged Trump to reconsider tariffs on goods from his country during a Monday phone call, warning that the measures could lead to a drop in Japanese investment in the United States.

Trump mentioned the call on his social media platform, calling the tariffs “tough but fair” and saying that Japan would be sending a “top team to negotiate.”

“They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,” Trump wrote. “They don’t take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other ‘things.’”

But Trump and Bessent — whom the president tasked with leading the negotiations — also expressed optimism about talks with Japan.

South Korea’s trade minister, Cheong In-kyo, is scheduled to visit Washington on Tuesday to discuss the blanket 25 percent tariff Trump announced for the nation’s goods.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government had also contacted the Trump administration over the 10 percent tariffs it faces despite Australia’s large trade deficit with its closest military ally.

Albanese, who has warned of the impact of steeper U.S. tariffs on Australia’s Asian trading partners, refused to rule out a recession on Tuesday as he campaigned ahead of a May 3 federal election.

Any U.S.-Australia trade talks could be complicated by a steady drumbeat of criticism from Republicans over biosecurity measures that prevent the importation of American beef.

“Australia has sold $29 billion worth of beef in the United States, and we haven’t been able to sell one hamburger in Australia because of barriers,” said Sen. John Barrasso (Wyoming), the chamber’s second-ranking Republican.

Trump posted a clip of Barrasso’s comments on his Truth Social account.
