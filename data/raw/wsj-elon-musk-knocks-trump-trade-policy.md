WASHINGTON—Billionaire businessman Elon Musk, one of President Trump’s most visible and influential advisers, is leveling veiled critiques at the White House’s trade agenda, exposing tensions within the administration over the president’s far-reaching tariffs.
On Monday morning, Musk posted a well-known video of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade by explaining how the component parts of a pencil require complex supply chains. That followed a weekend where Musk took aim at Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro, suggesting that his push for steep and broad-based trade barriers is wrongheaded. 
“A PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing, not a good thing,” Musk posted in response to a user on X who lauded Navarro’s education. Musk, who leads several companies, also implied that Navarro lacked hands-on experience in the economy. “He ain’t built s—,” Musk wrote.
Trump’s new tariff policies have cratered stock markets and caused concerns over a global economic slowdown. The president has said Americans should expect short-term pain as he attempts to reshape the American economy to make it less dependent on foreign-made goods. Last week, Trump announced universal tariffs on nearly all the world’s economies and imposed even steeper duties on many nations, erecting a towering trade barrier around the U.S. economy almost overnight. 
The moves have caused widespread confusion—particularly over whether Trump is committed to keeping the plan in place for years to boost U.S. manufacturing or if he is using the new tariffs as a negotiating ploy to force other countries to change their policies. 
The extent of the confusion was made apparent Monday morning when a stray comment by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett was misconstrued to suggest that Trump might pause the tariffs for 90 days, sending markets upward briefly. The White House clarified that no change in policy was planned, prompting markets to go back down.

There are other indications that parts of Trump’s coalition are souring on the White House. Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge-fund manager who backs Trump, called for a 90-day pause in the tariffs to negotiate with other countries, warning that the alternative was “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter.”
“We are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,” Ackman wrote on social media.
Ackman singled out Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, another Trump trade adviser, saying that he has a conflict of interest because of his investment strategy. “He profits when our economy implodes,” Ackman wrote on social media. A Lutnick spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile, top White House aides used different rationales to explain the purpose of the tariffs over the weekend.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted that the overall goal was to open a negotiation. “He has created maximum leverage for himself,” said Bessent on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Bessent said more than 50 countries had approached the White House about lowering their trade barriers, suggesting that opening trade talks with other countries was a main objective. 
Lutnick took a harder line, saying on CBS’s “Face the Nation”: “We got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.”
Billionaire hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman called for a 90-day tariff pause to negotiate with other nations.
Musk, over the weekend, floated the idea of a free-trade zone between the U.S. and Europe. “I hope it’s agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,” Musk said, appearing virtually Saturday at a political rally in Italy.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyden said Monday that Europe was ready to negotiate with the U.S. and offered “zero-for-zero” tariffs on industrial goods. Navarro called it a “good start,” but said countries must address “non-tariff cheating.” 
Navarro told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday he hadn’t yet spoken with Musk, but expected to at some point Monday at the White House. “Everything is good with Elon,” Navarro said, praising his work to cut government spending.

He played down Musk’s comments, suggesting that trade policy wasn’t part of Musk’s remit and explaining that within the administration his perspective was seen as that of a “car manufacturer” and a “car assembler.” Musk is the chief executive of Tesla, one of the world’s largest makers of electric vehicles.

“He is a car person,” Navarro said. “That’s what he loves.”
Musk has made critical comments about White House priorities in the past, taking aim at a $500 billion venture involving billionaire Sam Altman’s OpenAI to build data centers in the U.S. Musk questioned the endeavor shortly after Trump announced it, saying the companies didn’t actually have the money.
Trump brushed off the dust-up, explaining Musk’s remarks as part of a personal feud between Musk and Altman. “He hates one of the people in the deal,” Trump said.
