WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS, April 7 (Reuters) - A global trade war touched off by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs escalated further on Monday, as Trump threatened to increase duties on China and the European Union proposed counter-tariffs of its own.
Financial markets across the globe posted a third day of losses as investors worried that steep trade barriers around the world's largest consumer market could lead to a recession. The S&P 500 closed lower after a rollercoaster session in which it touched its lowest level in more than a year.

Trump said the tariffs - a minimum of 10% for all U.S. imports, with targeted rates of up to 50% - would help the United States recapture an industrial base that he says has withered over decades of trade liberalization.
"It's the only chance our country will have to reset the table. Because no other president would be willing to do what I'm doing, or to even go through it," he told reporters at the White House. "Now, I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end."
Trump spoke hours after he ratcheted up a confrontation with China, the world's No. 2 economy.
Trump said he would impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China on Wednesday if it did not withdraw the 34% tariffs it had imposed on U.S. products last week. Those Chinese tariffs had come in response to 34% "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
The European Commission, meanwhile, proposed counter-tariffs of 25% on a range of U.S. goods, including soybeans, nuts and sausages, though other potential items like bourbon whiskey were left off the list, according to a document seen by Reuters.
Officials said they stood ready to negotiate a "zero for zero" deal with Trump's administration. "Sooner or later, we will sit at the negotiation table with the U.S. and find a mutually acceptable compromise," EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a news conference.
The 27-member bloc is struggling with tariffs on autos and metals already in place, and faces a 20% tariff on other products on Wednesday. Trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on EU alcoholic drinks.
Trump said his administration would open trade talks with Japan, one of Washington's closest allies in Asia, and administration officials say dozens of other countries have reached out as well with the hope of heading off the tariffs as high as 50% due to take effect on Wednesday.
The back-and-forth injected further turbulence into global financial markets, which have fallen steadily since Trump's announcement.
U.S. stocks swung wildly, spiking after a report that Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause, then turned negative again after the White House dismissed the report as "fake news."
Asian and European shares plunged as investors feared the duties Trump has likened to "medicine" could lead to higher prices, weaker demand and potentially a global recession. Goldman Sachs raised the odds of a U.S. recession to 45%.
Trump administration officials say the president is following through on a promise to reverse decades of trade liberalization that he believes has undercut the U.S. economy. But they also said he is willing to negotiate with dozens of countries that have reached out for talks.
"He's doubling down on something that he knows works, and he's going to continue to do that," White House economist Kevin Hassett said on Fox News. "But he is also going to listen to our trading partners, and if they come to us with really great deals that advantage American manufacturing and American farmers, I'm sure he'll listen."

China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders. Beijing called Trump's behavior "economic bullying".

NEW REALITY OR NEGOTIATING PLOY?
Investors and political leaders have struggled to determine whether Trump's tariffs are permanent or a pressure tactic to win concessions from other countries.

Some governments in Asia have signalled a willingness to engage.

Investors are now betting that the growing risk of recession could prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates as early as next month. Trump repeated his call for the central bank to lower rates on Monday, but Fed chief Jerome Powell has so far indicated he is in no rush.
